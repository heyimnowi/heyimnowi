## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Nowi

I am a software engineer based in Barcelona, and I have almost 10 years of experience in the software industry. What sets me apart is my ability to quickly ramp up on new technologies and my problem-solving skills. I'm a great researcher, and I have expert googling skills, which helps me find creative solutions to complex problems. Taking on new technical challenges and expanding my knowledge is something that I enjoy. I find mentoring junior developers fulfilling as I get to help them reach their potential. Brainstorming new concepts, taking on various roles, and working closely with different teams to achieve success are activities that I enjoy.
